# Testing Swift macros

## try! Swift Tokyo 2024

> Macros are little compiler plugins that allow us to extend the Swift language in ways that do not require going through Swift evolution, or waiting for a Swift core team member to implement the feature, or require us learning C++ so that we can try implementing the feature ourselves. It is an incredibly powerful new feature, but can also be incredibly complex to get right. Let's explore how to debug and test every aspect of macros, from the code they expand to, to the errors and warnings and fix-its they emit.
